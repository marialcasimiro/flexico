## More results not featured in the paper

We created an appendix with more information about our experimental results which you can consult in zenodo:

## Data for reproducing the results of the paper

The FIDs and other data files required to run Flexico and reproduce the results of the paper can be downloaded from zenodo:

Prior to re-producing the results from the paper, it is **necessary to specify the path to the data files in file `src/constants.py`**.



## Required software

In order to reproduce the experiments, the user needs **version 4.8.1 of the PRISM model checker** (as described in the paper).

The PRISM model checker can be downloaded from its official page 
[https://www.prismmodelchecker.org/download.php](https://www.prismmodelchecker.org/download.php)
and installed on Linux, MacOS and Windows.

**The path to the PRISM executable must be specified in `src/constants.py` with the `PRISM` macro**.

Flexico relies on python: `requirements.txt` lists the required packages and corresponding versions.



## Running Flexico
To run Flexico or any of the other baselines described in the paper, one of the following commands can be executed. 

More information can be obtained with `--help`.
